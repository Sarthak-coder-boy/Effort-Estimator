            <h1 class="title">What is Effort Estimation ?</h1>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Effort estimation is the process of forecasting how much effort is required to develop or maintain a software application. This effort is traditionally measured in the hours worked by a person, or the money needed to pay for this work. 
             Effort estimation is used to help draft project plans and budgets in the early stages of the software development life cycle. This practice enables a project manager or product owner to accurately predict costs and allocate resources accordingly.

             <h2 class="title">Importance of Estimation </h2>
             <h3 class="sub-title">In all organizations, before starting actual production or filling up the tenders, estimation is done. Therefore, accurate estimating is necessary to compete in the market and to be sure whether manufacture of a particular product will be profitable or not. Both over and under estimating are dangerous. Over-estimating leads to increase the cost and hence tenders may not get suitable response. Under-estimating may lead to heavy losses to the concern. Hence accurate estimating is very essential and, therefore, staff of the estimating department must be well qualified, experienced and trained in this profession.
                 <br><br>
                 For example, a concern wants to start the manufacturing of lathe-chucks. The firm finds through market survey that its market price is approximately 150 dollars. But estimated price for the manufacture is more than this value. Then the drawings may be sent back to design function, to find out and alternate design, so that price can be reduced. If reduction of price is not possible then idea of manufacturing the chucks would be dropped otherwise it would lead to a great loss.</h3>
