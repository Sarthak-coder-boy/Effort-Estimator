            <h3 class="sub-title">
                Using effort estimation, technology teams determine how long the development of a product or program will take, how many people they need and what it might cost. The teams can assign values to the development of different projects to determine where they might need additional people or resources
                <br><br>
                There are several ways you can estimate effort for traditional software development:   
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Expert Estimation </u> : Expert estimation means having the people responsible for completing tasks, like developers and QA members, estimate how long they might need to complete them.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Formal Estimation </u> : Formal estimation uses quantitative data to estimate the time and resources to complete tasks. This often involves reviewing historical data on similar projects for estimation.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Combination-based Estimation  </u> : Combination estimation uses various sources to estimate efforts for a project. This can include averaging estimates from various experts or several similar projects.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Breakdown Estimation </u> : In breakdown estimation, a team takes a larger development project and lists each task it will complete. The team then estimates efforts for each task and combines those to understand the resources it needs for the entire project.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Positive/negative Estimation </u> : Positive and negative estimation involves people who have differing views on project estimates to understand the range of possible outcomes. In this, teams estimate the median between an expert who believes, for example, a project may take many hours and another who believes they can complete it quickly.</li>
                </ul>
